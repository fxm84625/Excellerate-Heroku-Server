# Excellerate
- Created in a 24-hr Hackathon.
- Back-End for an Excel script that helped Users learn Excel shortcuts.
- Works with an Excel script that is coded using VBA.
- When Users click on a Ribbon, the script will show a prompt to display the shortcut corresponding to that Ribbon button.
  - This would help users save time, because it is faster to do a keyboard shortcut than to move the mouse and click.
- User statistics are saved in MongoDB, and displayed on a stats page.
  - User statistics are based off how many times they used the mouse to click, and how many times they used the keyboard shortcut.
